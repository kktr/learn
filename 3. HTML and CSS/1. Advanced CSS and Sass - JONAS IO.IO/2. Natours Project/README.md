<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Natours - a project from the Advanced CSS course, with the help of which I was able to learn the world of animation and pseudo-element in CSS and SASS more deeply.

## Features

Coming out of the course framework I did an optimization based on google light house.
Technologies used: yarn, webpack, HMR, postcss(autoprefixer), critical css, webp, srcset, change background image form CSS to HTML, lazy loading, local fonts.

The project is overloaded with animations for skill training.

The next step will be to work on making the website responsive. The next two projects will be built using flex and grid, that I already know.
